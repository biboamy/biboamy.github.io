				I am currently a Sr Audio Machine Learning Researcher at <a href="https://moises.ai/">Moises AI</a> Before joining Moises, I was a research engineer at TikTok Inc. 

				I received my master's degree in Music Technology working with <a href="https://www.alexanderlerch.com/">Prof. Alexander Lerch</a> at <a href="https://music.gatech.edu/master-science-music-technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. <br><br>
				During my master's degree, I have interned at Bytedance SAMI, Netflix audio algirithm team, and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) Speech & Audio group. 
				
				Before studying at Georgia Tech, I was a research assistant working with <a href="http://mac.citi.sinica.edu.tw/~yang/">Dr. Yi-Hsuan Yang</a> in <a href="http://musicai.citi.sinica.edu.tw/">Music and AI Lab</a>, Academia Sinica. <br><br>

				My research interests focus on applying machine learning to various music information retrieval problems, including instrument recognition, audio/music auto-tagging, transcription, beat tracking, chord recognition, and music source separation.
