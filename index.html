				I am currently a Sr Audio Machine Learning Researcher at <a href="https://moises.ai/">Moises AI</a>. Before joining Moises, I was a research engineer at TikTok Inc. <br><br>

				I received my master's degree in Music Technology working with <a href="https://www.alexanderlerch.com/">Prof. Alexander Lerch</a> at <a href="https://music.gatech.edu/master-science-music-technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. 
				During my master's study, I have interned at Bytedance on SAMI team, Netflix on Audio Algirithm team, and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) on Speech & Audio group. <br><br>
				
				Before studying at Georgia Tech, I was a research assistant working with <a href="http://mac.citi.sinica.edu.tw/~yang/">Dr. Yi-Hsuan Yang</a> in <a href="http://musicai.citi.sinica.edu.tw/">Music and AI Lab</a>, Academia Sinica. <br><br>

				My research interests focus on applying machine learning to various music information retrieval problems, including instrument recognition, audio/music auto-tagging, transcription, beat tracking, chord recognition, and music source separation. <br><br>
					                
                <p>I write application and website sometimes. I like to learn playing different musical instruments. Currently working on upright bass ðŸŽ» </p>
